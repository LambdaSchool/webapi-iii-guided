# Middleware notes

## Jargon

Separation of Concerns

We do not write code for the computer, code is a communication device,
a way to reveal our intentions to the next developer.

** everything is Middleware!! **

- Almost everything

## Types (based on how we got it or who built it)

- built-in: included with express. ex: 'express.json()'
- third party: must be installed from 'npm'
- custom we code these.

## Types (based on how its being used.)

- global: runs on every request
-

- order matters, it goes top to bottom and left to right
